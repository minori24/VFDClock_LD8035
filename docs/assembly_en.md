### Pin Headers and Pin Sockets
Snap off pin headers and pin sockets required numbers and mount on the following places.
**Pin Headers**
 - Arduino Nano
 - J3 (5 pins x1)
 - Power Supply Module (4pins x 2)

## 3. VFD
Install VFD tubes V1 - V6.
Start with the pins with red tube, insert the pin into hole on the PCB marked with circle.
Every time you finish installing one VFD tubes to PCB, do not solder all pins. Temporarily solder red tube pin so that you can adjust alignment of all tubes.

## 4. Voltage Adjustment
Set the multimeter to voltage measurement mode and connect it to VOUT+ and VOUT-. Insert Arduino Nano on the PCBA, and connect USB cable to USB Smartphone charger.
Adjust output voltage of the VOUT+ and VOUT- to 15V by rotating VR with screwdriver (Counter-clockwise to increase voltage). Output voltage may not increase for a number of rotations, keep rotating the VR until output voltage reaches desired voltage.

Pull off the USB cable and mount R1 - R6 after you finish the voltage adjustment.

## 5. Install RTC Module
Install RTC modules.
Connect USB Cable to Arduino, you will see the VFD counting time.
